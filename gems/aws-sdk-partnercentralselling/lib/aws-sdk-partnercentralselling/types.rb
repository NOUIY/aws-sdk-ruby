    #     representative, and the partner solely manages the opportunity.
    #     It's possible to request coselling support on these opportunities

    #     latent (Your account team believes it exists based on research,
    #     account plans, sales plays).
    #
    #   * Qualified: Your account team engaged with the customer to discuss
    #     viability and understand requirements. The customer agreed that
    #     the opportunity is real, of interest, and may solve
    #     business/technical needs.

    #   * Technical Validation: All parties understand the implementation
    #     plan.
    #
    #   * Business Validation: Pricing was proposed, and all parties agree
    #     to the steps to close.
    #
    #   * Committed: The customer signed the contract, but Amazon Web
    #     Services hasn't started billing.
